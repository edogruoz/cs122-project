## Project Desc. and Goals
Transportation is one of the sectors that contributes the most to climate change.
Use of personal vehicles as opposed to public transportation or biking, as well as car choice, cause increased greenhouse gas emissions and exasperate global warming.
Toning down personal car use is an important step the average person can take against global warming.  
We want to build a software system that, given your car model and information on how much you drive, gives you an estimate of your carbon emission due to personal vehicle usage and how much you should decrease your car usage based on a comparison with the average person’s carbon emission due to car usage in the U.S. 
The average value might still be too high for this purpose, but drivers who are above average decreasing their usage to the average value would still make a significant impact.

## Data Sources
* [Fuel Economy](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws) is a US government website that gives information about the greenhouse gas emissions of car models starting from 1984.  
* [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions) is a federal website that gives information about greenhouse gas emissions in the US by sector (and car type within transportation) and year.

## Pending Timeline
Date   | Task
------ | ----
Feb 7  | &#9744; Write code to get the two data tables (id - car model & id - emission)
Feb 14 | &#9744; Write code to merge data tables
Feb 21 | &#9744; Write function that takes in model and use, and returns emission
Feb 28 | &#9744; Write function that compares emission with average and gives rec.
Mar 7  | &#9744; Translate the output to a user interface

### Potential supplementary tasks
* Autocomplete car model inputs
